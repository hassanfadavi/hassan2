    Temperature Logger:

    Objective: Store daily average temperatures for a week and retrieve a specific day's temperature.

    Steps:

    Declare a 1D array of size 7. This will represent temperatures for seven days.
    Assign a temperature value to each day.
    To find the temperature on the 4th day, access the element at index 3 (since array indices start from 0).
    Print the temperature value retrieved from the array.

    NOTE: You need to use scanner to enter the temperature for each day and store them into 1Dimention Array.
